1.  Required constants
	-players 1 & -1
	-Maximum turns for a draw

2. Required variables to track the state of the game
	-8x8 2D nested arrays
	-Tally of each player's captured pieces
	-Turn toggle
	-Jump available
	-Selected piece
	-Turn counter

3. Cache DOM elements
	-Game board, forfeit button

4. On load
	Initialize & then render:
	-Board with 12 of each player's pieces occupying the first three rows, black squares only. Use 1 and -1 to represent player 1 and -1's pieces, 0 for empty
	-Set each player's score to 0
	-Set toggle to 1, jump available to false, selected piece to null

5. On each turn
	-Check whether a jump is available

	When Player clicks a square
	-If it's one of Player's pieces, highlight the square, if not, do nothing.

	With a piece selected
	-Highlight legal destination squares when they are hovered over. 
	-Display a message if an illegal move is attempted, including if a jump is not taken
	-When a legal destination is selected, update the array to reflect the move
	Legal moves: 
	-Regular move: [x + 1 (or -1 if kinged), y (+1 or -1)] = 0
	-Jump [x + 1 (or -1 if kinged), y (+1 or -1)] = Opponent's piece and corresponding [x + 2 (or -2 if kinged), y (+2 or -2)] = 0
	-Jumps can chain
	
	If the move is a jump
	-Move the piece
	-Remove the opponent's piece and add one to their captured piece count
	-Set draw counter to 0
	-Check whether another jump is possible; if so, continue the turn

	If the move take the piece to the end of the board
	-King it, if it isn't already

	Check for a winner. Three ways to win:
	-Captured pieces count = 12
	-Other player has no legal moves
	-Too many turns have elapsed without capture; call a draw and determine winner by most pieces captured (kings as tiebreakers)

	If there's a winner, display it, with a replay button, otherwise reset jump available, selected piece; add one to draw counter, multiple toggle by -1 to switch turn

When a player clicks forfeit: the other player wins immediately
When a player clicks restart: reinitiatlize the game

	

-Try using the .cursor css property to turn the cursor into a checkers piece when a space is selected (while making a move)
-Note menu div is interfering with game clicks
