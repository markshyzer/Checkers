# Checkers

## Description

 Checkers is a strategy board game for two players. Players alternate turns a single move or one or more connected jumps on each turn. Pieces move diagonally one square at a time, and must move forward only until they have been 'kinged' by reaching the opponent's home row. Players capture opposing pieces by jumping over them; jumps must be taken if available and several connected jumps may be strung together in a single turn.
 
 A player wins by: 
 - Capturing all their opponent's plieces or 
 - Forcing their opponent into a position where no legal moves are available.
 
 If no capture is made within 40 moves, the game is a draw.
